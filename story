Ivan is your average hermit living in a cave somewhere in the Siberian
wilderness. After an incredibly long vodka nap, Ivan wakes to two unprecedented
natural phenomena: First, the cave is unbearably hot, with highs of at least -10
degrees. Ivan mutters something about global warming and capitalist pigs under
his breath. Speaking of pigs, Ivan finds himself sharing his cave with a whole
sea of them! "WHO TURNED MY CAVE INTO A PIGSTY!?" he roars, but only gets a
distant oink in response. You must now play as Ivan, the irritated hermit. Fight
pigs and eat jerky of questionable edibility as you try to leave your own cave
to find out just what the blyat is going on.
